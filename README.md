# Hello there!

Have you ever tried navigating the London Underground during rush hour? It's like a tightly coupled neural network, but hey, staying calm under pressure is my superpower (a valuable skill for any data role, wink wink).

I'm confident you'll find my curiosity, skepticism, and ability to translate complex data insights into actionable solutions. Plus, I bring a probabilistic mindset to the table ‡πÇ always looking at challenges through the lens of "what-if?" This might come in handy when tackling those real-world data problems.

## I'd be a good person to hire for:

*  üìä Data Science: With my Master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Liverpool, I've honed my skills in taming the wildest of algorithms, allowing me to research and prototype cutting-edge ML-based products and solutions. From my experiences at Aspiration Energy (R&D) and the University of Liverpool's DIF (R&D), I'm well-versed in exploring uncharted territories and turning theoretical concepts into tangible solutions.
  
* üî¨ As a polyglot in the language of data, fluent in Python, PowerBI, SQL, and an impressive collection of libraries and frameworks, I possess a deep understanding of statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining. My consulting projects have equipped me with the ability to unleash the power of data, from exploratory analysis to deploying production-ready models, driving data-driven decision-making.
  
* üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Software engineering: With almost 5 years of experience as a Data Analyst and API Developer, contributing to companies like Amazon (e-Commerce) and AnywhereWorks (Product), I've developed expertise in building scalable data pipelines. I can architect efficient end-to-end solutions for data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, and deployment, seamlessly integrating machine learning into production environments.

## Domains of interest

Here are some domains I'd be particularly interested in working in:

*  Autonomous digital agents
*  Autonomous physical agents, e.g., autonomous vehicles
*  E-Commerce
*  Product Management
*  Robotics
*  Logistics and transportation
*  Manufacturing
*  Energy

This said, I'm open to working in any domain where I can learn something new and interesting amongst fantastic peers.

So, if you're looking for a data professional with technical expertise and a healthy dose of humor, look no further! Let's embark on a journey to turn data into insights, and maybe even find the answer to the age-old question: why do cats always land on their feet?
